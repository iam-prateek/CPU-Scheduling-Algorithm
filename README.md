# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithm

Overview

This project is a web-based application designed to provide a visual and interactive understanding of various CPU scheduling algorithms. It allows users to compare different algorithms based on average turnaround time and waiting time. Additionally, the application offers animations to visualize the execution of each algorithm.

Features

Visualization: Animated representation of CPU scheduling algorithms.
Comparison: Clear tabular comparison of average turnaround and waiting times.
Algorithm Implementation: Includes standard algorithms like FCFS, SJF, LJF, and Round Robin.
Hybrid Algorithm: A novel scheduling algorithm combining elements of Round Robin, SJF, and priority scheduling.
User-friendly Interface: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for an intuitive experience.

How it Works

The application provides a user-friendly interface to input process details (arrival time, burst time). Users can then select the desired scheduling algorithm and visualize its execution. The calculated average turnaround and waiting times are displayed in a tabular format for easy comparison.

Technologies Used

HTML: Structure of the web page.
CSS: Styling and layout of the application.
JavaScript: Implementation of scheduling algorithms, animations, and user interactions.
